# motivations

Political scientists rely critically on regression and related methods in order to answer our substantive questions of interest. It is easier than ever to run a thousand regressions—or, as is increasingly common, to prompt an LLM to  analyze the data in our stead. But while our collective proficiency with statistical software has increased over time, our proficiency with the *statistics* themselves has lagged behind. Often, we lose sight of the key assumptions we are making about our data, the implications of these assumptions, and whether or not it is appropriate to continue invoking them. There are both known unknowns (assumptions we know we are making but are unsure are justified) and unknown unknowns (assumptions embedded in the choice of the model that we are unaware of because of our lack of familiarity with the statistical model itself). A deeper understanding of the underlying math should help prevent us from making critical modeling errors that stem from faulty assumptions. So let us take a peek under the hood.
